# Weather-Dashboard
## Overview
For this assignment we were tasked to create a weather dashboard. For this assignment we needed to use the open weather API and have a search function in which users would be able to search for a city and get today's weather along with the 5 day forecast. We needed to show a picture of the weather and provide temperature, humidity, wind speed & UV Index.

## Learning

With this assignment I felt we definitely were able to test our skills with everything we learned so far and put them to the test. I was able to learn more about APIs and be able to get data from them and manipulate items on the page based on data from them. I was also able to practice my bootstrap skills.
